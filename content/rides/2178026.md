## Salt Line Sportive 2025 

Meet at the G &amp; D to ride down to the start/finish at Cliff Dickenson &amp; Sons in Winsford the ride starts at roughly 8 am.  Sign up on the website for 50 miles or 75 miles route which is mainly flat.  Feed stations along they way, drinks and food provided at the start/finish line then cycle back to HC.  When we have details of the route we can post on this event.
Thanks Sam &amp; Phil
