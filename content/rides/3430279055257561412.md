## 🎅🎄🚴‍♀️🍻 Tinsel Ride 2025 

START TIME 0900
Come along and join all the other cycling Santas and Elves for the club’s annual Tinsel Ride. Come wearing something seasonal and Christmassy or just pimp your bike with fairly lights and some tinsel. 
The ride will follow our trusted route, anticlockwise again this year with the option of a loop up Artists Lane and through Mottram before heading to Mobberley and back through Tatton Park. 
Refreshments will be available at the George  of course on our return around 1200. If you can’t make it to the ride or don’t fancy the weather 
(1) MTFU 🎅 🧑‍🎄 💪 and
(2) Come along for a drink with your club mates anyway.
