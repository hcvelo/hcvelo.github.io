## Coffee and Ice-cream Sunday Social 

A number of people are in the running again for a monthly Everest and as the weather looks fine we will be taking on some much loved hills this weekend. Brickworks, Windgatherer, Goyt Valley with a return down to Blaze Farm and home. Expect it to be around 80km/50 miles. Exact route to be posted when I get back from visiting the Northern Outpost of HC Velo in Scotland.
