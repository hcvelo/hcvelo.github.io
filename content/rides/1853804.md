## Tinsel Ride 2024 

This Sunday sees our most popular ride of the year, the club Tinsel Ride. Dig out your Santa/Elf/Reindeer suit/cycling jersey and pimp your bike with some tinsel. We will be setting off from the G&amp;D at 0900. The route is anti clockwise so we will head out to Goostrey, Over Peover and Great Warford. 
From here we have an option extend the route to head up Artists Lane and do a loop round Over Alderley before heading back to Great Warford and joining the shorter ride towards Mobberley. 
Then it is back through Ashley, Tatton Park and Byley.  Back in the village we stop for a few drinks and perhaps some lunch at the George.
