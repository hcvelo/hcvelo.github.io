## Sunday Social 

Steady ride out to Beeston Castle and back to work off that turkey. Changed to an 8:30am start to avoid the dark and the worst of the cold. Aiming to have 2 groups setting off, an A group and a B group, but will be decided at the G&amp;D.

### Date

Sunday, 28 Dec : 08:30

### Start

George and Dragon, Middlewich Rd, Crewe, CW4 7EA, United Kingdom
