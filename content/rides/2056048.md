## Bank Holiday Sunday Nifty Fifty (Queens Stage) 

Join us this Sunday for the club&#39;s Queens Stage.  Lots of great climbs, but we will take this at a steady pace and leave nobody behind.  We expect a good turnout as many people are close to their monthly Everest target and it is a 50 point stage in the Challenge.  Depending on numbers, we may split into 2 or more groups.  Plenty of opportunities to stop for coffee en route.

### Date

Sunday, 25 May : 08:00

### Start

The George &amp; Dragon, Holmes Chapel
