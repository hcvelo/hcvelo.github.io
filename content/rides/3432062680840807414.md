## Santa&#39;s Sleigh Ride 

On Thursday 18th December we are once again running the &#39;Santa&#39;a Sleigh Ride&#39; in Holmes Chapel. The sleigh is kindly provided by Holmes Chapel Partnership, we just provide a Santa and his helpers.
Our route is from The Cottins, then Westmorland, Northway and Sadlers Close. We start at 5:30pm and should be complete by 7:30pm.
If you are willing to be one of Santa&#39;s helpers for a couple of hours on the night and help collect donations from the residencies on the route, then please accept this invitation on Strava.
We will send out further details to all the interested helpers nearer the time.
Thanks
