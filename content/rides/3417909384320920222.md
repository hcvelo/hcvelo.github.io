## Lymm via Knutsford and Arley Hall - closkwise route for sunday 2nd November 

Sunday social ride .Meet at 8am at the George and Dragon.
Two rides again this week a A group and B group doing the same route. The groups will start out together and may split at some point. I will stay and lead the B group. Based on last week the A group may be 26-28kph and the B group will be 24-25kph so hopefully this caters for all riders wanting a sunday social.
All riders to meet up if they wish for a coffee at the Bottlebank at the end of the ride
