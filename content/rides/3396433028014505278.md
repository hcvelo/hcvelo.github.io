## Sunday Soclal Cobbles 

A relatively short (40 mile) ride out to Bollington and Alderley Edge taking in a couple of familar climbs of Redesmere and Birtles Lane before we head to the cobble sections of Beeston Brow and Swiss Hill.  For those of you who haven&#39;t done it before there is nothing major to worry about, just take it nice and steady.  Lot&#39;s of bonus points for the challenge too.  Coffee back in HC.
