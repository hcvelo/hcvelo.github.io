# Riding With HC Velo

## Introduction

At HC Velo we aim to organise bike rides for all our members that appeal to a wide range of abilities that are fun, friendly and socially inclusive.

It is accepted that all members on a club ride have a duty of care to each other and for this reason we have compiled the following guidelines which all members should acquaint themselves with and adopt during formal club rides.

## Insurance

Membership of HC Velo does not include personal insurance or third-party insurance. It is strongly recommended that members arrange their own insurance cover. Personal membership of British Cycling would provide this cover although it should be noted that there are different levels of membership which provide different levels of cover. ‘Member’ level provides third party insurance and ‘Premium Membership’ level includes personal accident cover.

Please feel free to discuss this with any committee members if clarification is needed.


## Selecting the right ride for you

There are several rides which occur on a weekly basis. The rides will be of varying length, elevation, speed and therefore it is important for individuals to assess the appropriate rides that suite their abilities. Formal rides are open for all club members. Each ride will have an allocated ride leader who will be responsible for publishing the proposed ride on the HC Velo Strava page.

* All formal club rides will be published on the HC Velo Strava page.
* Rides will have a designated start location and time for departure.
* Rides will be categorised dependant on distance, elevation and average speed as follows:


| Ride Category | Distance    | Elevation | Average Speed |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| A             | 100+ km     | >1200m    | 24-28 km/h    |
| B             | 60-100 km   | 600-1200m | 22-24 km/h    |
| C             | 40-70 km    | 200-400m  | 20-22 km/h    |
| D             | 20-40 km    | <200m     | 18-20 km/h    |
| CG            | Chain Gang  |           |               |
| T             | Tempo       |           |               |
| G             | Gravel      |           |               |

Note: Rides may be published with a combination of categories ie CAT A (speed)/B (distance) depending on the Ride Leaders view of the ride.

* Please select the right ride suitable for your ability and fitness
* Consider distance, elevation, speed of ride, no-drop or not.
* Members should confirm your attendance on the ride by accepting the Strava invitation. This is important so that ride leaders know the right numbers for the rides and can check attendance before setting off.

## Before the ride

It is important that the following information is considered before any club ride. If you have any queries regarding any item before the ride, please contact the ride leader or raise the query on the HC Velo “Rides’ WhatsApp group.

**You**

* Ensure you know who the ride leader is.
* Where possible ensure you have downloaded the route to your personal device.
* If you have accepted the invitation but are unable to attend, please notify the ride leader.
* Consider the weather forecast and ensure you have appropriate cycle clothing for the conditions. Club kit is preferred for formal club rides.
* A cycle helmet should be worn on all group rides.
* Consider the appropriate drink, energy bar/gel/refreshments required for the planned journey.
* Ensure you have emergency contact details with you.

**Your Equipment**

* Lights should be fully charged (it is recommended that you should at least have a rear light on all rides. Front and rear lights required in poor visibility and dusk/dark conditions)
* A fully charged mobile phone.
* A fully charged Garmin or Wahoo device with the appropriate route loaded on it.
* Carry a spare inner tube, tyre levers, multi-tool and a pump or gas canister for inflation.

**Your Bike**

* Ensure your bike is clean, roadworthy, and safe.
* Your bike should be free from rattles and appropriately lubricated.
* Tyres should be inflated to the correct pressure.
* Brakes and gears should work properly.
* Mudguards should be used in wet or wintery conditions.

## Immediately before the ride

* Introduce yourself to the ride leader if you don’t already know them.
* Introduce yourself to other group riders if you don’t already know them.
* Listen to any briefing and raise any questions if you are unsure.

## During the ride

As a general introduction to group riding please watch and familiarise yourself with the information contained within the following video.
{{< youtube 93dprSqdL5s >}}

In general terms please follow the following key points throughout any ride:

* Follow the Highway Code
* Observe the Country Code, particularly with regard to responsible disposal of food/gel wrappers etc
* Ride with courtesy of others 
* Be aware of your fellow riders and other road users.
* Generally, ride two abreast when it is safe and appropriate to do so.
* Change the riders on the front of the group after approximately 10 mins to avoid excessive tiredness.
* Be aware of drivers behind you and allow them to overtake (for example, by moving into single file or stopping) when you feel it is safe to let them do so.
* When singling out, the outer rider moves into a gap formed behind the inner rider.
* Don’t wave vehicles through. The driver of the vehicle must decide for themselves when they consider it safe to overtake.
* Don’t overtake other riders on the inside.
* Ride behind the rear wheel of the rider in front of you. DO NOT overlap wheels. If they move suddenly off their line, you could both end up falling off your bikes.
* Avoid breaking sharply unless in an emergency in which case shout ‘Stopping!’ to make others aware.
* Be aware of traffic and obstacles and point out any necessary hazards to fellow group members.
* If you are towards the back of the group and there is a car following shout ‘car back!’ to the rest of the group
* If you are to the front of the group on a narrow road and there is a vehicle approaching shout ‘car up!’ to the rest of the group.
* Remain alert. Listen and watch other riders and repeat any messages or signals up or down the group.
* Do not use mobiles phones, headphones when riding. If you need to make a call inform the group and stop at the next safe place.
* Do chat and enjoy the ride but always remain alert.
* If you are struggling for any reason inform the group/ride leader as most social rides operate a no-drop approach.

## Hand signals

Know the meaning of and how to use standard cycling hand signals. Please watch the following GCN video for great information on the use of hand signals.
{{< youtube prYMM7D2qF8 >}}

Generally, the following signals will be used during a ride:

* ‘Car Back’ – if a car is behind you.
* ‘Car Up’ – for oncoming traffic.
* ‘Hole’ or ‘Gravel’  together with pointing to indicate poor road surface.
* ‘Car/Horse/Runner….’ – along with hand behind back to alert riders of hazard.                                                           
* ‘Slowing’ – along with arm moving up and down.
* ‘Stopping’ – along with arm held up.
* ‘On your right’ – if overtaking a fellow rider (always overtake on the right).

**Whatever your concern, query or issue………if you don’t know the answer then please ask.**
